* Years with the highest number of birthdays in the period under review: 1883, 1880, 1881.
* Definitely more children were born in the later years of the period studied.
* Year after year there is a clear upward trend in the number of births of both girls and boys.
* Initially, more girls were born, but around 1940 there was a change and more or less since then, more boys than girls were born every year.
* Around 1910 there was a significant increase in the total number of births.
* Another significant increase in the total number of births was around 1945.
* The most significant decrease in the total number of births was recorded around 1975.
* The peak in the total number of births in the period under review was recorded around 1955.
* There was a significant decline in the popularity of the most popular male and female names since around 1965.
* Since around 1965, fewer and fewer parents have given their children popular names. Downward trend continues for boys, however, for girls around 1988 there has been a significant increase in the popular names among the girls.
* Based on selected years: 1880, 1920, 1980, 1985 among men's names the letter n appeared most often as the last letter of the name. In the case of women's names it was the letter a.
* Among the selected most popular last letters of men's names: d, e, n, s the letter n is constantly more and more popular in the examined period the remaining selected letters are noting significant decrease in popularity.
